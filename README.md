**Smart Camera AI using TensorFlow Lite**

 A real-time object detection system that simulates an embedded AI-powered smart camera using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV, suitable for IoT, robotics, and edge computing applications.

Project Aim This project aims to replicate a smart vision system commonly used in embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, ESP32-CAM, or Jetson Nano. It uses a lightweight .tflite model to detect and label multiple objects in real time via webcam, mimicking low-power AI deployment.

**Features**

Real-time webcam-based object detection
Uses pre-trained MobileNet SSD (TensorFlow Lite)
Lightweight and fast — simulates embedded systems
Easy to integrate with Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.
No cloud required — runs entirely offline
Requirements Install required Python libraries:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy

**Use Cases**

Smart surveillance systems

Traffic monitoring & vehicle detection

Edge AI development on Raspberry Pi / Jetson

Object-aware robotics and drones

Low-power, offline IoT devices
